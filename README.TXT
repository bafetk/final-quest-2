I changed the input routine for the primary Reference file.  It increases
speed a little, but not as much as I expected.  I am still reluctant to
use an array for different parts of the reference file, but it might come
to that.  The input routine, or inputer$ function, uses binary to do an
"Input" style routine.

Not much externally, but a bunch of internal routines were revamped to
make them move efficient.  Also, the SETTINGS.DAT and OPTION.DAT and
SET2.DAT files no longer exist.  I made a routine to store their values
into an array.  Also, added VOB function.

Brought the damn thing up to speed with Quest for Power. It is now at
the surpassing stage.  I have taken The leveler 3.0 for QFP and altered
it for FQ2.  It is now v3.1 2000.

Initial.  I am writing this on 2/17/01, but I just had to write something
here..  This was the very first time that I thought of Final Quest 2. I
took the FQ version 1.6 file and just started adding innovations, like the
different screen loader.  I started with only like 10 to 25 screens
originally, and now I am at 1920.  It sure has come a long way.  I started
Final Quest 1 on 6-21-98.
