I. Introduction

	When I started out to create a game that had a huge kick into the 
TEXTPIC world, I thought of Final Quest.  The first episode contained a 
world where you could walk around, and a world where you could converse 
with different people.  I thought up of the idea for this game on 6-21-98
while I was messing around with an idea for a previous game I had been
working on.  I started my quest and only seven days later, on 6-28-98, I
came out with Final Quest Version 1.0.  The only problem with that world
was that you could not go explore any other screens in any way.  I created
six different versions, all with the disappointment of not being able to let
people go onto other screens.  This is why I created Final Quest 2.  The
whole purpose is to let people explore the world that I, or you, had created
for them.

II. Game-play

        No gameplay as of yet... But if you would like to help me with this,
        email me at xxxx@xxxxxxxx.com... I might let you do the entire game
        play and put your name in the Credits and on my site...

III. Ref File

	I wanted to create a system that could be flexible.  That is why I 
came up with the Ref gaming system. It allows me to pick out any spot on the
screen, and then give it a function.  This system allows me to do warps, and
all the other goodies that this game includes. I also have the ablility for 
variables, as shown in the REFFILE.TXT

IV. Level Creation

        I wanted to create a gameing engine that could be altered from the
outside. So hence, you can basically create your own game with my engine.
Use the LEVEL.EXE to setup the maps.. USE REFEDIT.EXE to edit the Reference
file and your all set with your own game..  You can edit everything..

NO.EXE -- Uses EDIT.COM to edit NOSCR.DAT
VAR.EXE -- Uses EDIT.COM to edit VARIABLE.DAT
REFEDIT.EXE -- Uses EDIT.COM to edit FQREFS.DAT
LEVEL.EXE -- Uses FQ2LEVEL Engine to edit FQMAPS.DAT

Update (03/23/01):  I have redone the below, so it is accurate.

V. The cheat code

	Ever get stuck in a game?  Well, here is your chance to get out.  If
you ever want to get out of a jam, you can type in HELPME while playing the
game to give you 25 hit-points every time you press it.  The only thing that
is bad is that it takes all your score away in the process.  The score
erasion was put in to discourage people from using the HELPME code..


VI. The Future

        The future of Final Quest 2 is as follows... You will be able to
compile your Ref files and run the game so no one can see your code!!!
More to come..

UPDATE:  I tried the compile thing and it was too slow, so I threw it out
the window.  I have updated this game so much since its first revision,
that I think that I will just wing it from now on.


VII. Trouble-shooting

        I have never had a problem with the game.  It should work perfectly 
on all systems.  If it goes to slow, then maybe you should try upgrading your 
system!  Try running readme.exe for suggestions...

UPDATE:   Got rid of README.EXE
